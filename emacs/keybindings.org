* General

** Motions

- change: =c=
- delete: =d=
- yank: =y=
- case: =g~= (swap), =gu= (upper), =gU= (lower)
- shift: =>= and =<=

Word motions:

- next word: =w=
- next WORD: =W=
- start of word: =b=
- start of WORD: =B=
- end of word: =e=
- end of WORD: =E=

More info [[https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html][here]].

** Text Object

- word: =aw= or =iw=
- sentence: =as= or =is=
- paragraph: =ap= or =ip=
- single/double quote: =a"=/=a'=/=a\==
- [] block: =a]= or =i]=
- () block: =a)= or =i)=
- {} block: =a}= or =i}=
- <> block: =a>= or =i>=
- tag: =at= or =it= (e.g. <a></a>)

'a' include white spaces, 'i' doesn't.

=diw=, =daw= with your cursor over 'this': (this , is, a, word)

** Buffers

- New buffer: =SPC b N=
- Save buffer: =SPC b s= or =:w=
- Switch to workspace buffer: =SPC ,= or =SPC b b=
- Switch to buffer: =SPC <= or =SPC b B=
- Close others: =SPC b O=

** Windows

- Split vertical: =C-w v=
- Split horizontal: =C-w s=
- Move: =C-w h/j/k/l=
- Move next (recommended): =C-w C-w=
- Rotate: =C-w r= and =C-w R=
- Close: =C-w q=
- Close others: =C-w o=
- Resize vertical: M= and M'
- Resize horizontal: M[ and M]

** Evaluating emacs lisp

1. Eval using =SPC ;=
2. Go to a scratch buffer, swap to emacs-lisp-mode and =SPC m e b=
3. Place the cursor on the last parenthesis of an s-expr and =C-x C-e=

* Ediff

On the Magit buffer press =e= on the merge conflict file.

You press =A= (HEAD) or =B= (master) or =+= (A+B).

When finished, press =q= and you will go to a buffer with the resulting file.

** Commands

- =?=: help
- =!=: recompute difference regions
- =|=: toggles horizontal/vertical split
- =r=: restore hte old content of the region in the merge buffer.
- =i=: info about current ediff session.
- ...
